# The typeface this story draws in

Recorded from the journalist's own answer, from no measurement — this is what resvg, Chrome and Canvas fall back to on their own.

Space Grotesk is not installed on this machine and a family that does not resolve is refused rather than swapped; Courier New resolves but sets every digit on one grid, which is a distraction in a chart whose whole argument is two number series converging. The stated fallback is recorded as a choice, with the gap named.

`NEWSROOM.md` records `typefaces: "Space Grotesk, Courier New"`. Every one of them was measured here before anything was written: a family that does not resolve is refused rather than swapped, because resvg renders the fallback and reports nothing, as do Chrome and Canvas.

`origin: default` is the honest word. Nobody chose this stack — it is the substrate's own, and recording it as a value rather than leaving it as a literal in the renderer is what makes the gap visible: until the recorded face is on the machine that renders, these beats are not set in it.
