// THE TWO COLOURS A BASEMAP IS ALLOWED, AND WHY THEY ARE MEASURED RATHER THAN CHOSEN.
//
// A fixed dose cannot work across three grounds. At 0.14 of the filed water hue, `nocturne` rendered
// sea and land at 1.014:1 — the same colour. A dark blue mixed into a navy ground produces no
// separation at all. The original escaped this by accident: its sea took the ACCENT, and nocturne's
// accent is a pale mint, which lightens.
//
// So the rule targets a MEASURED gap and takes the smallest dose that reaches it: the basemap stays
// as quiet as it can while a coastline still reads.
