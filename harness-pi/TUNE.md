# TUNE — misses the harness cannot fix

Tom's triage (REMI §3): each miss has one owner. A miss lands here only when its exact state was replayed
and no harness change (refusal text, code-owned paperwork, bound) can fix it. Training waits until this
file holds such misses (plan K9); nothing below is proved untunable yet.

Source: `bun eval/replay-scan.ts --since 2026-10-28` (92 sessions, 58 kept runs, local 12B, route
`llama-server`), 2026-11-07. "Next call succeeds" = the refusal's feedback worked, through any tool.

## Candidates (watch, not yet owned by Tune)

| Miss | Evidence | Why not Harness yet |
|---|---|---|
| Re-records the same gesture list after a failed web/scrolly render instead of fixing `beat.mjs` | 41 "list already recorded" refusals in 10 sessions, next call succeeds 5 | The refusal stops the loop; the miss is the repair after a failed render. Re-measure on the hardest leg (T4) before owning it. |
| Names a mark the beat does not draw | 24+6 refusals in 13 sessions, next call succeeds 16+4 | The refusal recovers most of the time; whatever is left is the model's reading of the drawn names. |
| Prose claims a record no tool made | 16 turns in 10 sessions | The record is code's (nothing is written without a tool), so the claim misleads only the transcript. Count it on the 26B (T3) before calling it a 12B trait. |
