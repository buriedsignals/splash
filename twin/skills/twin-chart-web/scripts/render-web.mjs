//
// The render ladder's third rung. Rung one (`twin-chart-beat/scripts/render-still.mjs`) turns a
// React element into a PNG; rung two (`twin-chart-video/scripts/render-video.mjs`) turns a
// Remotion composition into an mp4; this turns ONE React element — geometry-only SVG plus its HTML
// furniture, both drawn by the same component — into one self-contained HTML file: SSR'd
// server-side, one inlined interaction script, no external request.
//
// SECOND BUILD (see `references/web-discipline.md`, "Responsive behaviour"): the first build of
// this file mapped a component over an ARRAY of `WebLayout`s, SSRing one SVG per pre-rendered
// width and swapping between them with a CSS media query. The owner's own read of that shipped
// output was that it did not fill its container — a fixed 900px cap with empty gutters either
// side — and asked for a genuinely continuous fill instead, edge to edge, height growing with
// width rather than the width being capped. `ChartWebSeed` now draws ONE fluid frame; this file
// SSRs it ONCE and stops mapping over layouts entirely.
//
// It runs in node, which is why it is the piece that derives the furniture colours and measures
// the one gutter this genre still measures (the y-axis label column — see `ChartWebSeed.tsx`):
// `deriveFurniture`/`measureText` live beside a native rasteriser in this skill's OWN
// `./render-still.mjs` — a copy of `twin-chart-beat`'s, because a skill never imports another
// skill — which no browser bundle can load. Deriving here and passing ink/muted/grid/measure in as
// props keeps ONE implementation of the colour rule and the text-measurement rule per render,
// exactly the pattern `render-video.mjs` already set; the copies are kept in step by
// `splash-twin/test/helper-parity.test.ts`.
//
// `renderWeb` below is the genre's own machinery and knows nothing of any one story: it takes the
// component and the props to call it with as arguments, and it never reaches into the component's
// own returned markup — the SSR'd `<figure>` (geometry SVG, HTML furniture, filter, all of it) is
// dropped into the page body verbatim. `buildCss` below is the genre's shared stylesheet: the
// structural CSS grid, the fluid sizing rule, the filter's own `:checked` dimming, the tooltip —
// every class name a component targets (`.chart-figure`, `.chart-plot`, `.seg`, `.pt`, `.axis-label`,
// `.note`, `.end-label`, `.hit-area`, `#tooltip`) is a documented CONTRACT between this file and
// `ChartWebSeed.tsx`-shaped components, the same contract `.pt`/`.hit-area`/`#tooltip` already were
// in this genre's first build. Everything under the CONFIG marker (the CONFIG block, `render`, the
// CLI block) is the runner for THIS SKILL'S OWN SEED — `assets/ChartWebSeed.tsx`, drawn from
// `assets/sample-data/` — which is the same "the skill's script hosts its own worked values behind
// a labelled seam" shape Tom's own reference skills use (`map-explainer/scripts/prep-geo.mjs`'s
// `COUNTRIES`/`RIVER`/`ANCHOR_BBOX`, `cesium-flyover/scripts/prep-cesium-path.mjs`'s `START`).
//
// It is the seed's runner and not a story's for one hard reason: NOTHING IN THIS FILE MAY IMPORT OUT
// OF THIS SKILL. A real beat writes its own runner in this shape beside its own story
// (`proof/co2-suisse/render-web.mjs` is exactly that from this genre's first build), importing its
// own component and its own props; `renderWeb` itself does not change for it.
//

/* THE FLUID FILL — the redesign this file exists to ship. .chart-figure and everything inside
   .chart-plot take the FULL width of whatever contains them, edge to edge, no max-width cap and
   no fixed rung to swap between. Height is never independently set on the plot: aspect-ratio
   (set per-render on .chart-plot's own inline style, from the component's real geometry) grows
   the height WITH the width, so a very wide container gets a taller chart rather than a flat,
   letterboxed strip -- the failure mode capping the width would otherwise avoid at the cost of
   empty gutters, and the failure mode letting width AND height both float freely would risk
   instead. Only the two places a long line of prose would become unreadable at full bleed -- the
   header block and the source line -- are given a reading-measure cap; the chart itself never is.

   "Fills the container" is a claim about the FRAME's own edges, never about the content inside
   it -- FRAME_PAD_PX is the fixed inner margin that keeps that distinction real: title, caveat,
   filter, every axis label, the end label and the source line all sit inside it, so nothing ever
   touches the frame's own edge at any width. box-sizing:border-box (above) is what makes width:100%
