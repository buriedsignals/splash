// Verifies what a MAP BEAT carries, after the render ladder has proved it exists.
//
// `render-map.mjs` runs the join and the claim check and produces a still, a final frame and an mp4.
// Nothing until now asked the two questions this format's own doctrine spends most of its words on:
// does the baked plate describe the same geography the marks were projected into, and is it on the
// same side of the theme as the ground the beat declares.
//
// THE SUBSTRATE IS THE BAKE'S OWN OUTPUT. `bake-plate.mjs` writes `plate/plate.png` and
// `plate/geometry.json` beside each other, and `geometry.json` records the FRAME the marks were
// projected into. Both questions are therefore decidable from two files — exactly, with no
// rasteriser, no browser and no screenshot. `plate/plate.png` is decoded by this skill's own
// `compare-png.mjs`, which is why the plate's luminance needs no canvas either.
//
// WHY NOT `projectionDisagreements`. That decision compares an `<img>`'s CSS `object-fit` against the
// `preserveAspectRatio` of the SVG drawn over it. Measured across this tree, `object-fit` appears in
// exactly two files, both scrolly IMAGE beats, and in no map component at all: a map beat composites
// its plate as an `<image>` INSIDE the marks' own SVG, in the marks' own coordinate system, so there
// are not two projections that could disagree. The same DEFECT is reachable here by another
// mechanism, and `plateMatchesGeometry` is what decides it.
