// twin/skills/map-web/scripts/bake-plate.mjs
//
// The bake for the web format's proportional-symbol seed: one camera, one basemap capture, one
// file of projected point positions. No polygon rings and no data join — a symbol map has neither
// (`map-beat/references/types/proportional-symbol.md`: "there is no data JOIN for this
// type") — so this is a lighter bake than a choropleth's: points in, projected pixels out.
//
// After this runs there is no map anywhere in this skill, same invariant `map-beat` ships:
// the interactive HTML draws an `<image>` and some `<circle>`s through `render-web.mjs`.
//
// This is `doctrine/references/geo-discipline.md` rules 1, 2, 4, 6 in one script (rule 3 does
// not apply — nothing here is a polygon) — read before touching this file:
//   1. the frame gate is `idle` OR a bounded settle, and it records which one fired;
//   2. the plate is fixed, so the two responsive layouts this format ships never re-render tiles;
//   4. each point's own label is placed at its OWN projected pixel, in this beat's own typography;
//   6. capture plumbing — `preserveDrawingBuffer`, `--use-gl=angle`, a resolved Chrome path.
// Rule 7 (water reads as a blue tint, never grey) applies here MORE than to a choropleth: a
// point-based beat leaves nearly the whole plate exposed as basemap, so MapTiler's own
// `dataviz-light` near-grey water (`hsl(240, 2%, 88%)`) would be visible everywhere between the
// circles rather than hidden under polygon fills — this is the render that actually looks at it.
//
// A skill directory has to build after being copied into a journalist's root, so nothing under a
// skill may import out of it (`splash/test/no-cross-skill-imports.test.ts` fails loud on any
// specifier that does) — this file is this skill's OWN copy of the bake, not an import of
// `map-beat`'s or `proof/map-quake-symbol`'s.
//
// Usage:
//   bun skills/map-web/scripts/bake-plate.mjs --size 1000 --out /tmp/map-twin-web/plate-1000
//
// SIZE: baked generously (1000 logical px, ~2000 physical px at the capture's own 2x device pixel
// ratio) so the plate stays at or near native resolution when displayed full-width up to the widest
// tested viewport (1600px) — see references/map-web-discipline.md, "Full width, genuinely", for the
// exact numbers this trades off against file size and bake time.

/**
 * THE SEA, DERIVED FROM THE STORY'S OWN GROUND AND THE INK IT DRAWS WITH — the owner's instruction,
 * given twice: *"the ocean colours have to adapt to the palette."*
 *
 * IT WAS BUILT ONCE, FOR THE CHOROPLETH, AND THE BAKE NEVER GOT IT. `map-web/assets/geo-choropleth.ts`
 * derives a no-data fill and a water tint from the ramp and the ground (`offRampLuminance`,
 * `noDataFor`, `waterFor`) and refuses a pair a reader could not tell from a class
 * (`assertSurfacesRead`). Every bake in this tree meanwhile painted `#AAC9E0` unconditionally, or —
 * in the one copy of three that never carried rule 7's override at all — left MapTiler's own
 * near-neutral water alone. Measured on the page that made it impossible to miss
 * (`stories/r8-map-web-japan-bear-casualties`, ground `#16191B`, accent `#D4A853`): the plate came
 * back 66.9% water at relative luminance 0.5570 against a ground at 0.0094, so the SEA measured
 * 10.22:1 against the ground while the accent carrying the whole argument measured 8.02:1, and an
 * accent circle drawn over that sea measured 1.27:1 against a 3:1 floor. The largest and brightest
 * thing on a dark newsroom's page carried no data at all.
 *
 * WHERE THE SEA GOES, and it is `offRampLuminance`'s own answer with one bound added:
 *
 *   - THE BAND is between the ground and the nearest thing that carries data. Past the far end a
 *     surface reads as more than the maximum; inside, it reads as a value. A region with no reading
 *     is nearer to bare ground than to any class, and so is the sea.
 *   - THE MIDPOINT of that band is the placement, because it is the point furthest from both things
 *     the sea must not be confused with.
 *   - THE CEILING is the 3:1 non-text floor, measured from every ink this beat records: a mark drawn
 *     over the sea has to stay a mark. On a symbol beat this is what binds — Japan's midpoint is
 *     0.2178 and its ceiling 0.1088 — and on a choropleth, whose fills replace the plate rather than
 *     sitting on it, it never bites.
 *   - A CEILING PAST THE GROUND IS REPORTED, NOT OBEYED, and this is a real case rather than a
 *     defensive branch: `proof/mapgen-locator-web` and `proof/mapmore-flow-danube` draw `#C68900`
 *     (relative luminance 0.2988) on a WHITE ground, and 3:1 under that accent is luminance 1.0000 —
 *     white itself. No tint at all sits between their ground and their ink, so the placement falls
 *     back to the midpoint and says so in `ceilingUnreachable`, with the number. The bake prints it
 *     and writes it into `geometry.json`; whether a mark is REALLY unreadable is then measured on the
 *     finished plate at each mark's own pixel by `plateSurfacesYieldToInk`, which is the only place
 *     that can know. A derivation that guessed here would refuse three correct beats.
 *   - NO ROOM IS A REFUSAL, never a quiet literal. A band narrower than two clearances cannot hold a
 *     surface that is neither the ground nor a class, and the answer is to raise the ramp's own low
 *     end, which is what `assertSurfacesRead` already tells a caller in the same situation.
 *
 * IT IS THE SAME ANSWER THE CHOROPLETH CORE ALREADY GAVE, and that is measured rather than claimed.
 * `geo-choropleth.ts`'s `waterFor(ramp, ground)` — the derivation the owner's instruction produced
 * the first time, for the one format that got it — places the sea at exactly this midpoint. Checked
 * on three real palettes in this tree (`#FFFFFF`/`#B2182B`, `#FFFFFF`/`#0B7A75`, `#16191B`/`#D4A853`):
 * the two functions return the IDENTICAL hex, `#f0f6fa`, `#f2f7fa` and `#313a40`. What this adds is
 * the ceiling, which a choropleth never needs because its fills replace the plate, and which a
 * symbol beat cannot do without because its marks sit on the water.
 *
 * THE HUE IS FIXED AND THE LUMINANCE MOVES, so the sea stays blue on every ground: `#505e69` on
 * Japan's charcoal, a paler blue on a white one. And the finished hex is measured again after
 * quantising to 8 bits, because a tint that lands one step the wrong side of the floor is a tint
 * this function claimed and did not deliver.

 * below the world AND halves every country — and because the delivered page sizes its map box from
 * the plate's own aspect, a square plate then sits as a square in the middle of a 1600px page with a
 * gutter either side. The map did not take the width it was given, which is the visible half of the
 * same defect.
 *
 * `minFrameHeightPx` above is this same derivation for the one camera that spans a full turn of
 * longitude — where the frame width IS the world width — and it was in this file the whole time,
 * used only to build an error message. This is it for every other camera: divide by the longitude
