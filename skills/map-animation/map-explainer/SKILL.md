# Map Explainer — 2D geographic explainer maps

## Overview

A flat investigative map beat: a **river (or route) draws on**, and as it flows into each country the
country **animates in** — its border draws, its fill blooms, its label rises. The bundled assets are a
working sample; replace all geography, visual tokens, and typography with the production's own system.

For 3D terrain fly-overs use the **cesium-flyover** skill; for plain animated maps see remotion's
`maps.md` / `maplibre.md`.

## When to use

- "Where is this?" / "what's the path of this river/route?" / "who is upstream of whom?"
- A choropleth-style reveal where countries or regions light up in a meaningful sequence.
- **Not** for: 3D terrain reveals (→ cesium-flyover) or non-geographic data viz.

## Architecture — three layers, each one job

| Layer | Role |
| --- | --- |
| **MapTiler SDK** (`@maptiler/sdk`) | Draws the basemap + all GeoJSON layers (river, fills, borders) into a WebGL canvas. Default styled-vector starting point: `MapStyle.BASIC`; satellite is an equally valid evidence-led choice. |
| **Remotion** | Frame-by-frame harness. Imperatively update `setData`/`setPaintProperty`; use `jumpTo` only for a static shot, or a fixed map plate for any pan/zoom. Gate with `delayRender` until `map.once('idle')`. `--gl=angle`, `preserveDrawingBuffer:true`. |
| **React HTML overlay** | The country **labels** — positioned `<div>`s, NOT MapLibre symbols. Gives full project-defined typography and animation control. Positioned each frame via `map.project(lngLat)` → `setState`. |

Env `REMOTION_MAPTILER_KEY` (unrestricted). Init the map once (ref guard); update imperatively per frame.

Choose the basemap by evidence: begin styled-vector work with `MapStyle.BASIC`; use satellite when terrain,
land use, construction, or a river's physical course is itself evidence. The skill owns no fixed palette,
font, or branded treatment—put those in the production's local configuration.

## Motion stability — use a fixed map plate for camera moves

**Do not call `map.jumpTo()` on every Remotion frame when the camera moves.** In headless capture it can
make both MapTiler hillshade **and satellite imagery** shimmer/jitter, even when the source tiles load
correctly. This is renderer resampling, not a data, network, or label problem.

For the implementation, read **`references/render-stability.md`** before building or debugging any moving
map. It contains the fixed-map-plate recipe, diagnostics, and render checks.

- Use the live MapTiler camera only for a static shot.
- Keep pitch and bearing constant for a fixed plate. A genuine changing 3D camera needs the
  `cesium-flyover` skill instead.
- Verify the moving preview and a short rendered MP4 before approving a beat. If any basemap detail
  wavers, switch to the fixed-plate pattern; do not try to solve it with tile retries or camera easing.

## How it works (the shape)

1. **Geo prep** (`scripts/prep-geo.mjs`) → `country-meta.json` + `borders.geojson` + the river line.
   Per country it bakes: `stop` (river-arrival fraction), `anchor` (label centre = pole of
   inaccessibility), `border` (complete source geometry, never a viewport crop). Details → `references/geo-prep.md`.
2. **Basemap** — strip clutter on `load`: remove `symbol` layers (place labels) and `/other border/i`
   (admin-1 inner borders); hide the logo via CSS. Keep country + disputed borders.
3. **River** — `turf.lineSliceAlong(line, 0, lineKm*reveal)` per frame, led by a **white-hot electric
   draw-head** (the last few % in its own bright+glow layers), faded out at the mouth. No dark casing.
4. **Countries** — triggered as the river enters each (`stop`): a sequence of **complete border draws
   (constant ~2.5 s, darker-shade line) → fill blooms (opacity overshoot) → country label rises**.
5. **Render** — `npx remotion render … --gl=angle`.

The timing model, per-frame code, the electric-head logic, the country sequence, and label projection →
**`references/architecture.md`**. The geo pipeline (entry stops, pole of inaccessibility, complete
borders, bbox/nudge tuning) → **`references/geo-prep.md`**.

## Visual semantics — label and border rules

- **Country or geographic region:** uppercase, high-contrast display label with a short accent divider.
  Place it in clear territory, never over a river or marker cluster.
- **River or route:** anchor a leader directly to the real line geometry, then run it to the label. Use the
  route accent colour and omit redundant category words such as “RIVER”.
- **Constructed object** (dam, tunnel, plant, site): smaller italic callout beside its actual point or
  line. Do not use the country/region divider treatment; infrastructure is not geography.
- Reveal a label only after the geographic/data layer it names is established, and keep it on-screen long
  enough to read. Validate placement in both 16:9 and 9:16 renders.
- Use complete named administrative geometry. **Never crop a country or bilateral border to the viewport**
  to make its animation easier; it may continue off-frame naturally. For a highlighted bilateral boundary,
  source the named full bilateral line. For country fills, avoid duplicating full outline strokes, which
  makes shared borders double up.

## Quick start (adapt to a new river + countries)

1. Copy `assets/{RiverReveal,CountryLabel}.tsx`, `assets/tokens.ts`, and `assets/example-Root.tsx` into a
   Remotion project. The exact folder layout (component imports must line up with the geo files) → `assets/README.md`.
2. Supply a river GeoJSON (**one clean source→mouth LineString** — route braided OSM first; see
   `references/geo-prep.md`) + one polygon GeoJSON per country. Edit `scripts/prep-geo.mjs` `CONFIG`
   (`COUNTRIES`, input paths, `FRAME_BBOX`/`ANCHOR_BBOX`/`NUDGE`), run it → river line + `country-meta.json`
   + `borders.geojson`. (Or use the sample outputs in `assets/sample-data/` to render water-wars as-is.)
3. Keep the country keys identical across `prep-geo.mjs`, `RiverReveal.tsx` `ORDER`, and `tokens.ts` (the
   four-file contract in `assets/README.md`). Set `REMOTION_MAPTILER_KEY`; add a font package only if the
   project's typography requires one.
4. Render with `--gl=angle --timeout=120000` (`--gl=angle` is mandatory — WebGL map). Adapt-points → `assets/README.md`.

## Tuning knobs (each is one number)

| Want | Knob | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| River colour / electric glow | `COLORS.river` / `riverGlow` / `riverHead` | `assets/tokens.ts` |
| Electric head size | `lineKm * 0.03` + head/headglow widths | `RiverReveal.tsx` |
| Border draw time | `BORDER_S` (2.5 s, constant per country) | `RiverReveal.tsx` |
| Border visibility | lighten `COUNTRY_DARK` or bump `trail` width/opacity | tokens / component |
| Fill bloom strength | `[0,0.6,1] → [0, ×1.25, ×1]` overshoot | `RiverReveal.tsx` |
| Label position | `NUDGE` + `ANCHOR_BBOX` (pole of inaccessibility) | `scripts/prep-geo.mjs` |
| Label look | project typography, divider/callout treatment, letter-spacing | `CountryLabel.tsx` |
| When a country lights up | its `stop` (river-arrival fraction) | recompute in prep |
| Overall pace | `RIVER_START`/`RIVER_END` + sequence durations (beat length follows) | `RiverReveal.tsx` |

- `references/geo-prep.md` — basemap stripping + the geo pipeline internals.
- `references/render-stability.md` — required reference for camera motion, shimmer/jitter diagnosis, and stable headless renders.
