// Verifies what a chart VIDEO carries, after the render ladder has proved it exists.
//
// `render-video.mjs` proves a file was produced and its final frame looks right. Nothing until now
// asked whether the reveal that produced it is measured in a space its own length lives in. That
// defect is native to this format: a line reveal is a dash whose offset runs to zero, and every
// chart video that moves a camera or scales a plot is one `vector-effect` away from the version that
// draws head, hole and tail.
//
// WHY THIS READS SOURCE. A scrolly ships an HTML file whose marks a browser can be pointed at. A
// chart video ships an mp4 and PNGs — artifacts with no attributes in them. A video beat's marks
// exist as marks only inside Remotion's own render, and reaching in means driving `remotion/Internals`
// (its `Timeline` exports hooks and no context object; the render bundle speaks a private protocol).
// A guard built on another package's internals is brittle by construction. The limit this buys is
// named in `test/verify-video.test.ts` and the walking test there fails if this reader ever goes
// quiet.

 *  path's own user units. A dash pattern repeats forever, so a pattern one path-length long measured
 *  against a line the camera has scaled up draws dash, gap, dash: a head, a hole and a tail, sliding
 *  together as the offset moves. A DECORATIVE dash — a gridline, a leader — belongs in screen space
 *  and is left alone here; what is refused is a dash that measures, recognised by a declared

 *  object, or inside a `style="a:b;c:d"` string. One reader for both is what lets a format verify its
 *  own SOURCE where that is the only thing that exists (a chart video's marks live only inside
 *  Remotion's render) and its own ARTIFACT where the artifact is a real file (a web beat ships
 *  self-contained HTML).
 *
 *  Deliberately a text scan and not a parser: a scan cannot be wrong about an attribute that is not
 *  there. What it cannot see is a dash assembled elsewhere and spread in — stated in the
 *  test's header, and the reason the walking test asserts how MANY marks it found.
 *
 *  AN ABSENT OFFSET IS ZERO, NOT UNKNOWN. The DOM reader this mirrors gets `"0px"` from a computed
 *  style for an element that declares no offset; here the attribute is simply missing, and reading
 *  that as unknown would refuse every decorative rule in the corpus. */
