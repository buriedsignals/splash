 *  photograph or a font into a self-contained HTML or SVG file has never had its own delivered
 *  weight measured against anything at all.

 *  `ceiling` is a PARAMETER here, not a module constant the way `WEIGHT_LIMIT_BYTES` is: the number
 *  differs by format — a chart-web page and a mixed-media scrolly do not carry the same weight —
 *  so this shared function stays generic and each copy's own caller supplies a ceiling measured
 *  against ITS OWN format's delivered files, never a number this function would have to guess at.
 *  `over` is strictly `>`, not `>=`: a file sitting exactly on today's heaviest is the measurement
 *  the ceiling was taken FROM, not yet a violation of it. */
