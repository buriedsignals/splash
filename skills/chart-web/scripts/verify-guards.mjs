// The guards `chart-web` carries, kept in their own module so a TEST can import them.
//
// `verify-web.mjs` is this format's driver and it RUNS on import — its whole bottom half is an
// unguarded top-level run block that launches Chrome. A decision that only exists inside it is a
// decision no test can reach without spending a browser, so the decisions live here and the driver
// imports them and calls them on the artifact it just built. Both directions matter: a guard nothing
// calls does not run, and a guard nothing can import cannot be held to its copies.
//
// WHY THESE TWO. This format's output is ONE self-contained HTML file — chart, interaction, fonts and
// every asset inlined so it can be dropped into a CMS.
//
//   · the same asset inlined twice is bytes no reader benefits from, and a self-contained file is
//     exactly where that happens without anyone noticing;
//   · `vector-effect: non-scaling-stroke` is on nearly every gridline this format draws — 18 of the
//     23 web artifacts on disk carry it — which is CORRECT, a 1px rule must stay 1px in a fluid
//     frame. It is also one authored `stroke-dashoffset` away from a dash that measures its own path
//     in a space that path's length does not live in.

 *  there. What it cannot see is a dash assembled elsewhere and spread in — stated in the
 *  test's header, and the reason the walking test asserts how MANY marks it found.
 *
