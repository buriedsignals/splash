//   furniture  the six names, the baseline, the two series named in their inks                   0..1
//   wind       wind's bars rising across the six, each counting its share                        0..1
//   solar      solar's bars rising beside them one group after another, the lead counted         0..1
//   focus      the five where wind leads stepping back, the exception kept                       0..1
