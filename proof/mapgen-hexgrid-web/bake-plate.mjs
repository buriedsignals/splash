// This beat's own bake: one world camera, one basemap capture, every quake epicentre projected to
// pixel space. Binning happens afterwards, in node, on the projected points (`geo-hex.ts`) —
// `render-web.mjs` bakes first, bins second, the same order `proof/map-quake-density/render.mjs`
// follows for its own static format. Adapted from that beat's own `bake.mjs` (a point bake has no
// polygon join — camera, water-colour override, idle-or-settle gate, then `map.project()` per
// point) — this is this beat's OWN physical copy, sized for THIS beat's desktop web layout rather
// than the static beat's 900×560 frame, and writing into its own `/tmp` namespace so concurrent
// work on other beats never collides with it.
//
// Usage:
// The plate is FROZEN BESIDE THE BEAT, for the same reason its data is: a basemap living in `/tmp`
// cannot be committed, so the delivered artifact could not be reproduced or audited — and MapTiler
// restyles, so a re-bake months later is a different picture under the same marks. The render calls
// this bake only when the beat's own plate folder is empty.

/**
 * THE SEA, DERIVED FROM THE STORY'S OWN GROUND AND THE INK IT DRAWS WITH — the owner's instruction,
 * given twice: *"the ocean colours have to adapt to the palette."*
 *
 * IT WAS BUILT ONCE, FOR THE CHOROPLETH, AND THE BAKE NEVER GOT IT. `map-web/assets/geo-choropleth.ts`
 * derives a no-data fill and a water tint from the ramp and the ground (`offRampLuminance`,
 * `noDataFor`, `waterFor`) and refuses a pair a reader could not tell from a class
 * (`assertSurfacesRead`). Every bake in this tree meanwhile painted `#AAC9E0` unconditionally, or —
 * in the one copy of three that never carried rule 7's override at all — left MapTiler's own
 * near-neutral water alone. Measured on the page that made it impossible to miss
 * (`stories/r8-map-web-japan-bear-casualties`, ground `#16191B`, accent `#D4A853`): the plate came
 * back 66.9% water at relative luminance 0.5570 against a ground at 0.0094, so the SEA measured
 * 10.22:1 against the ground while the accent carrying the whole argument measured 8.02:1, and an
 * accent circle drawn over that sea measured 1.27:1 against a 3:1 floor. The largest and brightest
 * thing on a dark newsroom's page carried no data at all.
 *
 * WHERE THE SEA GOES, and it is `offRampLuminance`'s own answer with one bound added:
 *
 *   - THE BAND is between the ground and the nearest thing that carries data. Past the far end a
 *     surface reads as more than the maximum; inside, it reads as a value. A region with no reading
 *     is nearer to bare ground than to any class, and so is the sea.
 *   - THE MIDPOINT of that band is the placement, because it is the point furthest from both things
 *     the sea must not be confused with.
 *   - THE CEILING is the 3:1 non-text floor, measured from every ink this beat records: a mark drawn
 *     over the sea has to stay a mark. On a symbol beat this is what binds — Japan's midpoint is
 *     0.2178 and its ceiling 0.1088 — and on a choropleth, whose fills replace the plate rather than
 *     sitting on it, it never bites.
 *   - A CEILING PAST THE GROUND IS REPORTED, NOT OBEYED, and this is a real case rather than a
 *     defensive branch: `proof/mapgen-locator-web` and `proof/mapmore-flow-danube` draw `#C68900`
 *     (relative luminance 0.2988) on a WHITE ground, and 3:1 under that accent is luminance 1.0000 —
 *     white itself. No tint at all sits between their ground and their ink, so the placement falls
 *     back to the midpoint and says so in `ceilingUnreachable`, with the number. The bake prints it
 *     and writes it into `geometry.json`; whether a mark is REALLY unreadable is then measured on the
 *     finished plate at each mark's own pixel by `plateSurfacesYieldToInk`, which is the only place
 *     that can know. A derivation that guessed here would refuse three correct beats.
 *   - NO ROOM IS A REFUSAL, never a quiet literal. A band narrower than two clearances cannot hold a
 *     surface that is neither the ground nor a class, and the answer is to raise the ramp's own low
 *     end, which is what `assertSurfacesRead` already tells a caller in the same situation.
 *
 * IT IS THE SAME ANSWER THE CHOROPLETH CORE ALREADY GAVE, and that is measured rather than claimed.
 * `geo-choropleth.ts`'s `waterFor(ramp, ground)` — the derivation the owner's instruction produced
 * the first time, for the one format that got it — places the sea at exactly this midpoint. Checked
 * on three real palettes in this tree (`#FFFFFF`/`#B2182B`, `#FFFFFF`/`#0B7A75`, `#16191B`/`#D4A853`):
 * the two functions return the IDENTICAL hex, `#f0f6fa`, `#f2f7fa` and `#313a40`. What this adds is
 * the ceiling, which a choropleth never needs because its fills replace the plate, and which a
 * symbol beat cannot do without because its marks sit on the water.
 *
 * THE HUE IS FIXED AND THE LUMINANCE MOVES, so the sea stays blue on every ground: `#505e69` on
 * Japan's charcoal, a paler blue on a white one. And the finished hex is measured again after
 * quantising to 8 bits, because a tint that lands one step the wrong side of the floor is a tint
 * this function claimed and did not deliver.
